# University Project - Smart Data Analytics

## Goal 

During a week, the goal has been the explore the possibilities offered in R with regards to sentiments analysis and topic modelling. To do so, we used a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. 

## Data

The data is freely available at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/astoeckl/newsen
Note that an account must be created. 

## Repo Structure 

There are two folders: 
  - figures:  contains all the figures generated in LDA_Sentiments.Rmd
  - rscripts: contains the original R scripts that have been put together to create LDA_Sentiments.Rmd

The remaining files are: 
  - LDA_Sentiments[i].png:  prominent figures to be shown in the README.md
  - LDA_Sentiments.Rmd:     R Markdown to present and discuss briefly our results/findings.
  - metainfo.txt:           to link with Quantlets
  
 ## Note
 
Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we have not been able to fit LDA models to bigrams or to frequency-based fitlering method. This would be a great area for further analysis.
